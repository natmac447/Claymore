<current_state>
Phase 3 GUI is code-complete (both plans 03-01 and 03-02 executed). A 10-point physicality overhaul was performed from a cairn-design-review, followed by 4 additional fixes based on user screenshot feedback. All code compiles and is pushed to GitHub. Awaiting DAW verification of the latest 4 fixes.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
All 10 original physicality overhaul items DONE:
- #1 Cap + skirt knob construction with hairline lip
- #2 Heavy 5-pass drop shadows on knobs
- #3 Grain texture opacity 0.025f → 0.07f, applied to ALL zones (full bounds)
- #4 Beveled zone separators (shadow + highlight pairs)
- #5 Lighter cutout recess (0x2a2520 warm dark gray)
- #6 Embossed/debossed CLAYMORE title text
- #7 Indicator groove with shadow/highlight flanking
- #8 Knurled edge ticks on large knobs
- #9 Panel enclosure edge (beveled metal border)
- #10 Silk-screened label shadows

4 additional fixes from screenshot feedback DONE:
- #11 Knurl ticks now rotate with knob angle (was static)
- #12 Cap gradient changed from linear to radial (top-left light source)
- #13 Cap-to-skirt shadow ring (cap casts shadow onto skirt below)
- #14 Drop shadows on gate toggle (3-pass) and LED indicators (2-pass)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- DAW verification of fixes #11-14 (radial cap gradient, rotating knurls, cap shadow on skirt, toggle/LED shadows)
- If visual issues remain, iterate further
- Once GUI polish is satisfactory, Phase 3 is complete → transition to Phase 4 (Validation and Distribution)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Radial gradient for knob cap uses top-left highlight offset (centreX - 0.25*capRadius, centreY - 0.30*capRadius) for natural spherical lighting
- Cap shadow on skirt uses clip region (even-odd fill rule) to avoid darkening the cap itself — only the skirt ring gets the shadow
- Toggle shadow is 3-pass (smaller than knob's 5-pass) to reflect lower physical profile
- LED shadow is 2-pass (smallest) — LEDs barely protrude from surface
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — all code compiles cleanly, pushed to GitHub.

<context>
The GUI is in a design iteration loop. The core layout and all APVTS attachments are working. We're refining the visual physicality — making the plugin look like a real metal pedal rather than a flat illustration. The user is comparing against reference images of Dieter Rams Braun equipment, CNC knurled knobs, etc. Each iteration involves applying changes, building, loading in DAW, taking screenshots, and identifying remaining issues.

<next_action>
Load the plugin in DAW and verify the 4 latest fixes visually. If the radial gradient, rotating knurls, cap shadow, and toggle/LED shadows look good, Phase 3 is ready for completion. Otherwise, iterate on any remaining visual issues.
